| **Alvea is an innovative application designed to enhance productivity and user experience by leveraging generative user interfaces.**<br/><br/>Developed during [Generative UI hackathon](https://partiful.com/e/1antxX3cgLArJFGRNKg4) at [AGI House SF](https://agihouse.ai/), Alvea addresses the limitations of existing AI chat applications by offering dynamic, just-in-time user interfaces that adapt to the user's tasks and needs. | <img width="1136" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Glavin001/Alvea-AI/assets/1885333/c3a9287f-e17e-4889-b30c-2b2c57934a22"> |

## The Problem

Existing AI chat apps, while boosting productivity, fall short in delivering optimal collaborative and informational experiences due to their reliance on text-based communication.

## Our Solution

Alvea emerges as a solution to this problem by integrating AI to develop dynamically rendering user interfaces that are interactive and tailored to the user's current task.

### Key Features

<!-- - **Dynamic User Interfaces:** Unlike static interfaces, Alvea's UIs are interactive and adapt based on the input, providing a more efficient way to convey information and extract user preferences.
- **Visual Components:** Alvea incorporates appropriate visual components for task accomplishment, allowing for a collaboration between the AI and the user that surpasses traditional text-based interactions.
- **Customized Experience:** Focused on delivering the best customer experience, Alvea enables language models to visualize and communicate in the most effective way for every task. -->
